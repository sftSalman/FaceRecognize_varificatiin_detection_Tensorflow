# Face Recognition with FaceNet
![Uploading 1_3DUde1poGbZAOIaPQiE8GA.gifâ€¦]()

This project aims to provide an implementation of face recognition using the powerful FaceNet model. FaceNet is a deep learning model capable of generating high-quality face embeddings that capture unique facial features, enabling accurate face recognition.

## How FaceNet Works

FaceNet works by first detecting faces in images using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). Once faces are detected, the model extracts facial features and maps them into a high-dimensional space called an embedding space. 

In this embedding space, faces belonging to the same person are clustered closely together, while faces of different individuals are far apart. This allows for accurate discrimination between different faces based on their unique features.

The key innovation of FaceNet lies in its use of a triplet loss function during training. This loss function encourages the model to minimize the distance between embeddings of the same person's face while maximizing the distance between embeddings of different individuals. This results in face embeddings that are highly discriminative and suitable for face recognition tasks.
